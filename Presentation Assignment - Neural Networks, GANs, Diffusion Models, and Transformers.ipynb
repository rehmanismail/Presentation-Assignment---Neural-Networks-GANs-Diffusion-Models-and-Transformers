    "* The Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between produced and genuine data, by producing random noise samples.<br>\n",

Both of them work simultaneously to learn and train complex data like audio, video, or image files.\n",

    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of generative models in artificial intelligence that have revolutionized how we create and manipulate digital data. They are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and define a Markov chain of diffusion steps to slowly add random noise to the data and then learn to reverse the diffusion process to construct desired data samples from the noise.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The forward diffusion process is a process of turning an image into noise. It consists of multiple steps, where at each step, a small amount of noise is added to the input image using a schedule. The schedule decides how much noise is added at the given step t.<br>\n",

    "**Reverse Diffusion Process**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse diffusion process is a process of turning noise into an image. It consists of multiple steps, where at each step, a small amount of noise is removed from the input noise.

    "Transformers in Generative AI (GEN AI) are a type of neural network architecture that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing and other machine learning tasks. They are designed to track relationships between chunks of data, such as words in a sentence , and use this information to generate new data that is coherent and natural-sounding.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is GEN AI?**<br>\n",

    "GEN AI is a subset of Deep learning (a subset of Machine learning). It uses artificial neural networks and can process labeled and unlabeled data using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Transformer Model?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A transformer model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in a sentence. They apply an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the Transformer work?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder converts input text into an intermediate representation and passes it to the decoder, the decoder converts that intermediate representation into useful text. All the models before the transformer could represent words as vectors, but these vectors do not contain the context. The Transformer understands context through its self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different positions in the input sequence when processing each position, i.e., this mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input, similar to how we pay attention to specific details when reading or listening.<br>\n",

    "**What Can Transformer Models Do?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models are translating text and speech in near real-time, opening meetings and classrooms to diverse and hearing-impaired attendees. They’re helping researchers understand the chains of genes in DNA and amino acids in proteins in ways that can speed drug design. They can detect trends and anomalies to prevent fraud, streamline manufacturing, make online recommendations or improve healthcare. People use transformers every time they search on Google or Microsoft Bing.<br>\n",

    "Transformers are in many cases replacing convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs), the most popular types of deep learning models just five years ago. Indeed, 70 percent of arXiv papers on AI posted in the last two years mention transformers.

    "Before transformers arrived, users had to train neural networks with large, labeled datasets that were costly and time-consuming to produce. By finding patterns between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate that need, making available the trillions of images and petabytes of text data on the web and in corporate databases. In addition, the math that transformers use lends itself to parallel processing, so these models can run fast.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Transformers Pay Attention**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most neural networks, transformer models are basically large encoder/decoder blocks that process data. Small but strategic additions to these blocks (shown in the diagram below) make transformers uniquely powerful. Transformers use positional encoders to tag data elements coming in and out of the network. Attention units follow these tags, calculating a kind of algebraic map of how each element relates to the others. Attention queries are typically executed in parallel by calculating a matrix of equations in what’s called multi-headed attention. With these tools, computers can see the same patterns humans see.<br>\n",
